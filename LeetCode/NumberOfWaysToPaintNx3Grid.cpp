Two pattern for each row, 121 and 123.
121, the first color same as the third in a row.
123, one row has three different colors.

We consider the state of the first row,
pattern 121: 121, 131, 212, 232, 313, 323.
pattern 123 : 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.
So we initialize a121 = 6, a123 = 6.

We consider the next possible for each pattern :
  Patter 121 can be followed by : 212, 213, 232, 312, 313
  Patter 123 can be followed by : 212, 231, 312, 232

  121 = > three 121 patterns, two 123 patterns
  123 = > two 121 patterns, two 123 patterns

  So we can write this dynamic programming transform equation :
b121 = a121 * 3 + a123 * 2
b123 = a121 * 2 + a123 * 2

We calculate the result iteratively
and finally return the sum of both pattern a121 + a123
